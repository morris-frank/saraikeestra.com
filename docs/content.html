<section class="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Amsterdam, I'm passionate about understanding human health through an evolutionary lens. My
        research explores how our first 1000 days shape our health, with a particular focus on thyroid function and its
        evolutionary significance.</p>

    <h2>Beyond Research</h2>
    <p>When I'm not conducting research, you'll find me reading, singing, drawing, traveling, or enjoying movies with
        friends. I'm driven by curiosity and believe in making science accessible to everyone.</p>

        "What's the point of doing fascinating research if nobody knows about it? One of the most rewarding aspects of
        being a scientist is sharing our discoveries with others."
